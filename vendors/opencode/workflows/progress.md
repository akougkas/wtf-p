## Record contract

Read: `project://manifest`, `project://config`, `project://state`, `project://decisions`, `project://structure/outline`, `project://sections/{section}`, `project://checkpoints/{checkpoint}`, `project://validations/{validation}`.
Produce: none.

Resolve every logical URI through the host adapter. Portable v1 JSON records are the source of truth: schema-validate before a write, preserve stable IDs, update revision and timestamps where required, and replace records atomically. Never pass a literal logical URI to a shell command or infer record state from a legacy Markdown control file.

Manuscript prose and supporting context, research, plan, review, summary, handoff, and deliverable artifacts retain their authored format (normally Markdown). Link them from the relevant v1 record; do not convert manuscript prose into project-state JSON.

## Procedure

1. Validate and reconcile manifest, state, outline, section records, checkpoints, validations, and linked artifacts.
2. Compute status and counts from records and actual artifacts; report contradictions instead of silently repairing them.
3. Recommend one next action with its reason, prerequisites, and blocking checkpoint, if any.

## Safety and completion

Do not initialize a repository or run branch, stage, commit, merge, push, or publish operations. If requested, return a clearly labeled optional handoff for a separately authorized action.

Report the logical resources read, created, updated, archived, or deleted; the gates crossed; validation results; unresolved checkpoints; and the safest next action. Never claim a mutation that was not verified.
