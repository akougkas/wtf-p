- Unexpected: [Surprising discoveries]

### Act 3: The Resolution (Discussion)

**Insight:** [What it means]
- Interpretation: [How to understand the findings]
- Significance: [Why these findings matter]
- Contribution: [What we've added to knowledge]

**Transformation:** [How understanding changes]
- Before: [What people thought/did before]
- After: [What they can think/do now]
- Shift: [The conceptual or practical change]

**Horizon:** [What comes next]
- Immediate: [Next steps from this work]

## Reader Experience

**Hook:** [Why they keep reading past abstract]
- Opening question or scenario
- Why this matters to them
- Promise of insight

**Promise:** [What they'll learn]
- New understanding
- Practical tools or methods
- Answer to important question

**Payoff:** [The "aha" moment]
- Where the insight lands
- How findings click together
- Satisfying resolution

## Pacing

**Speed up (less detail):**
- Background everyone knows
- Standard methods
- Expected/confirmatory results

**Slow down (more detail):**
- Novel contributions
- Key methodology
- Surprising or important findings
- Critical interpretations

## Emotional Journey

| Section | Reader Feeling | Desired Transition |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Opening | Curious | → Engaged |
| Problem | Concerned | → Motivated |
| Approach | Interested | → Hopeful |
| Findings | Attentive | → Satisfied |
| Meaning | Understanding | → Convinced |
| Future | Thoughtful | → Inspired |

## Key Moments

**The hook:** [Opening line/scenario]
"[Draft opening sentence or scenario]"

**The turn:** [Where problem becomes opportunity]
"[Draft sentence that pivots from gap to contribution]"

**The reveal:** [Where main finding is presented]
"[Draft sentence presenting key result]"

**The resolution:** [Final takeaway]
"[Draft closing message]"

<guidelines>

**Why narrative matters:**
- Readers remember stories, not just facts
- Narrative creates engagement and flow
- Good papers tell a coherent story
- Even technical papers benefit from arc

**The three-act structure:**
- Act 1: Establish problem and stakes
- Act 2: Journey through investigation
- Act 3: Resolution and meaning

**Reader experience:**
- Hook: Why start reading
- Promise: What they'll gain
- Payoff: Satisfying conclusion

**Pacing:**
- Not everything needs equal detail
- Emphasize what's new and important
- Don't belabor the obvious

**Integration with argument-map:**
- Argument map = logical structure
- Narrative arc = emotional/experiential structure
- Both needed for compelling paper
</guidelines>

## The Story

### Act 1: The Problem (Introduction)

**World state:** AI writing tools are everywhere
- What exists: ChatGPT, Claude, and dozens of specialized tools
- What works: General writing assistance is improving rapidly
- Who's affected: Researchers, students, professionals

**Tension:** Researchers don't know how to use them effectively
- The gap: No systematic guidance for academic contexts
- The pain: Ad hoc usage leads to quality issues, ethical concerns
- The stakes: Potential to help or harm research quality

**Stakes:** Getting this right matters
- For researchers: More productive, ethical AI use
- For science: Better research communication
- Broader: Setting norms for a transformative technology

### Act 2: The Journey (Methods + Results)

**Approach:** Build and test a framework
- Strategy: Interview researchers, synthesize needs, develop guidance
- Innovation: Discipline-specific rather than generic approach
- Why this way: One size doesn't fit all academic contexts

**Discovery:** Framework improves outcomes
- Main finding: Researchers with framework reported better quality, less anxiety
- Supporting: Specific strategies vary by discipline but principles transfer
- Unexpected: Ethical clarity reduced anxiety more than productivity tips

### Act 3: The Resolution (Discussion)

**Insight:** It's about integration, not replacement
- The framework succeeds because it treats AI as tool, not author
- Key is matching AI strengths to researcher needs
- Transparency resolves most ethical concerns

**Transformation:**
- Before: "Should I use AI?" (anxiety, confusion)
- After: "How should I use AI for this task?" (confident, intentional)

## Key Moments

**The hook:**
"Dr. Chen stared at her half-finished methods section, the AI-generated text feeling foreign, the blank space feeling worse."

**The turn:**
"Yet the solution isn't to avoid AI tools—it's to integrate them intentionally."

**The reveal:**
"Researchers using the framework reported 40% less writing anxiety while maintaining quality standards."

**The resolution:**
"The question is no longer whether AI belongs in research writing, but how to use it responsibly."
