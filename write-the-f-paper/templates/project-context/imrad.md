## Section Details

### Abstract
**Purpose:** Summarize the entire paper in one paragraph
**Length:** 150-300 words (venue-specific)
**Structure:**
- Background/Context (1-2 sentences)
- Gap/Problem (1 sentence)
- Approach/Methods (1-2 sentences)
- Key Results (2-3 sentences)
- Implications (1-2 sentences)

**Write:** Last, after all other sections complete

### Introduction
**Purpose:** Establish context, gap, and contribution
**Length:** ~10% of paper
**Structure:**
1. Hook: Open with compelling context
2. Background: What's known, what exists
3. Gap: What's missing or problematic
4. Contribution: What this paper provides
5. Roadmap: Preview of paper structure (optional)

**The "funnel":** Start broad, narrow to your specific contribution

### Methods
**Purpose:** Enable reproduction and establish validity
**Length:** 15-25% of paper (varies by field)
**Structure:**
- Participants/Sample/Materials
- Procedure/Protocol
- Measures/Instruments
- Analysis approach
- Ethical considerations (if applicable)

**Key principle:** Someone should be able to replicate from this section alone

### Results
**Purpose:** Present findings without interpretation
**Length:** 20-30% of paper
**Structure:**
- Organized by research question or hypothesis
- Present findings with supporting data
- Include statistics, figures, tables as needed
- Describe what you found, not what it means

**Key principle:** Facts only; interpretation comes in Discussion

### Discussion
**Purpose:** Interpret findings and situate in literature
**Length:** 20-25% of paper
**Structure:**
1. Summary: Brief recap of key findings
2. Interpretation: What the findings mean
3. Integration: How findings relate to prior work
4. Implications: What this means for theory/practice
5. Limitations: Honest assessment of weaknesses
6. Future work: Where to go from here
7. Conclusion: Final takeaway (if no separate section)

**Key principle:** Connect your dots; help readers understand significance

### Conclusion (if separate)
**Purpose:** Leave readers with key takeaway
**Length:** ~5% of paper
**Structure:**
- Restate main contribution
- Key implications
- Forward-looking statement

## Common Variations

### Literature Review Section
Some fields include a separate "Related Work" or "Background" section between Introduction and Methods.

### Combined Results and Discussion
Some venues allow or prefer combined "Results and Discussion" sections.

### Structured Abstracts
Some journals require structured abstracts with explicit headings (Background, Methods, Results, Conclusions).

### Grant-Specific Structures
Grants often use different structures (Specific Aims, Significance, Innovation, Approach).
