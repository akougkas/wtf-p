description: Standard IEEE CS conference structure (HPC, parallel systems, storage)

structure:
  - number: 1
    name: Introduction
    slug: introduction
    word_ratio: 0.15
    purpose: |
      Problem statement and motivation. Clear contribution list.
      IEEE style: more formal, less narrative.
    subsections:
      - Problem Statement
      - Motivation
      - Contributions
      - Organization
    citation_density: medium

  - number: 2
    name: Background and Related Work
    slug: background
    word_ratio: 0.15
    purpose: |
      IEEE often combines background with related work upfront.
      Technical foundations + literature positioning.
    subsections:
      - Technical Background
      - Related Work
      - Positioning
    citation_density: very_high

  - number: 3
    name: System Design
    slug: design
    word_ratio: 0.22
    purpose: |
      Architecture and design decisions.
      IEEE emphasizes clear diagrams and formal descriptions.
    subsections:
      - Architecture Overview
      - Component Design
      - Algorithms
      - Optimizations
    citation_density: low

  - number: 4
    name: Implementation
    slug: implementation
    word_ratio: 0.10
    purpose: |
      Implementation specifics. IEEE values reproducibility details.
      Hardware/software environment, parameters.
    subsections:
      - System Implementation
      - Experimental Platform
    citation_density: low

  - number: 5
    name: Evaluation
    slug: evaluation
    word_ratio: 0.25
    purpose: |
      Rigorous experimental validation.
      IEEE expects statistical rigor and scalability analysis.
    subsections:
      - Experimental Setup
      - Performance Evaluation
      - Scalability Analysis
      - Comparative Analysis
    citation_density: medium

  - number: 6
    name: Conclusion
    slug: conclusion
    word_ratio: 0.08
    purpose: |
      Brief summary. Future work optional but common.
    subsections:
      - Summary
      - Future Work
    citation_density: none

optional_sections:
  - name: Acknowledgments
    position: after_conclusion
  - name: References
    position: end

citation_style: ieee
page_limit_hint: "10-12 pages (double column)"

notes: |
  - IEEE often wants Related Work early (Section 2)
  - Implementation details get their own section
  - Scalability analysis is expected for systems papers
  - Figures should be IEEE-compliant (grayscale-friendly)
