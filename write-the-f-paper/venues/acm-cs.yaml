description: Standard ACM CS conference structure (systems, databases, architecture)

structure:
  - number: 1
    name: Introduction
    slug: introduction
    word_ratio: 0.15
    purpose: |
      Hook the reader with the problem. State contributions clearly.
      End with paper organization paragraph.
    subsections:
      - Motivation and Problem Statement
      - Contributions
      - Paper Organization
    citation_density: medium

  - number: 2
    name: Background and Motivation
    slug: background
    word_ratio: 0.12
    purpose: |
      Establish technical context. Define key concepts.
      Motivate why existing solutions fall short.
    subsections:
      - Technical Background
      - Motivating Example
      - Problem Definition
    citation_density: high

  - number: 3
    name: Approach and Methodology
    slug: approach
    word_ratio: 0.25
    purpose: |
      Core technical contribution. System design, algorithms, architecture.
      This is the meat of the paper.
    subsections:
      - Overview
      - Design/Architecture
      - Key Techniques
      - Implementation Details
    citation_density: low

  - number: 4
    name: Evaluation and Experimental Results
    slug: evaluation
    word_ratio: 0.25
    purpose: |
      Prove it works. Benchmarks, comparisons, ablations.
      Answer: Is it faster? More accurate? More scalable?
    subsections:
      - Experimental Setup
      - Baseline Comparisons
      - Performance Analysis
      - Ablation Studies
    citation_density: medium

  - number: 5

    slug: related-work
    word_ratio: 0.12
    purpose: |
      Position contribution in literature. Show you know the field.
      Differentiate from similar work.
    subsections:
      - Category 1 (e.g., Systems approaches)
      - Category 2 (e.g., ML-based approaches)
      - Category 3 (e.g., Hybrid approaches)
    citation_density: very_high

  - number: 6
    name: Conclusion and Future Work
    slug: conclusion
    word_ratio: 0.08
    purpose: |
      Summarize contributions. Acknowledge limitations.
      Point to future directions.
    subsections:
      - Summary
      - Limitations
      - Future Directions
    citation_density: none

optional_sections:
  - name: Acknowledgments
    position: after_conclusion
  - name: Appendix
    position: end

citation_style: acm
page_limit_hint: "12-14 pages (double column)"

notes: |
  - Related Work typically comes AFTER evaluation in systems papers
  - Contributions should be bulleted and specific
  - Evaluation needs quantitative comparisons with baselines
  - ACM venues expect reproducibility (artifact evaluation)
