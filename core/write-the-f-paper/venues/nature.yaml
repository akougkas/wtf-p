description: Classic IMRaD structure for life sciences and Nature-family journals

structure:
  - number: 1
    name: Introduction
    slug: introduction
    word_ratio: 0.15
    purpose: |
      Funnel structure: broad context → specific gap → your contribution.
      End with clear statement of what you did and found.
    subsections:
      - Context
      - Gap
      - Approach
    citation_density: high

  - number: 2
    name: Methods
    slug: methods
    word_ratio: 0.25
    purpose: |
      Reproducibility is paramount. Every detail needed to replicate.
      Often moved to end or supplementary in Nature-family.
    subsections:
      - Experimental Design
      - Data Collection
      - Analysis Methods
      - Statistical Analysis
    citation_density: medium

  - number: 3
    name: Results
    slug: results
    word_ratio: 0.30
    purpose: |
      Present findings objectively. No interpretation yet.
      Each figure/table gets narrative explanation.
    subsections:
      - Finding 1
      - Finding 2
      - Finding 3
    citation_density: low

  - number: 4
    name: Discussion
    slug: discussion
    word_ratio: 0.25
    purpose: |
      Interpret results. Connect to literature. Acknowledge limitations.
      End with implications and future directions.
    subsections:
      - Interpretation
      - Comparison to Literature
      - Limitations
      - Implications
    citation_density: high

optional_sections:
  - name: Abstract
    position: before_introduction
    word_limit: 150-250
  - name: Acknowledgments
    position: after_discussion
  - name: Data Availability
    position: end
  - name: Supplementary Materials
    position: end

citation_style: nature
page_limit_hint: "3000-5000 words main text"

notes: |
  - Abstract is crucial - often only part read
  - Methods may be brief in main text, detailed in supplement
  - Results and Discussion sometimes combined
  - Figures are premium real estate - make them count
