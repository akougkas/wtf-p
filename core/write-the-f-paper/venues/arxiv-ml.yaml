name: arXiv ML/AI
short: arxiv-ml
description: Standard ML conference structure (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR style)

structure:
  - number: 1
    name: Introduction
    slug: introduction
    word_ratio: 0.12
    purpose: |
      Problem setup. Why this matters. Contribution summary.
      ML papers are dense - get to the point fast.
    subsections:
      - Problem and Motivation
      - Contributions
    citation_density: medium

  - number: 2
    name: Related Work
    slug: related-work
    word_ratio: 0.10
    purpose: |
      Position in literature. ML moves fast - cite recent work.
      Often brief, sometimes moved to appendix.
    subsections:
      - Prior Approaches
      - Concurrent Work
    citation_density: very_high

  - number: 3
    name: Preliminaries
    slug: preliminaries
    word_ratio: 0.08
    purpose: |
      Notation, problem formulation, background concepts.
      Keep it tight - reviewers know the basics.
    subsections:
      - Notation
      - Problem Setup
      - Background
    citation_density: medium

  - number: 4
    name: Method
    slug: method
    word_ratio: 0.25
    purpose: |
      Your algorithm/model. Math-heavy. Clear notation.
      Pseudocode welcome. Theoretical analysis if applicable.
    subsections:
      - Overview
      - Core Algorithm
      - Theoretical Analysis
    citation_density: low

  - number: 5
    name: Experiments
    slug: experiments
    word_ratio: 0.30
    purpose: |
      Empirical validation. Standard benchmarks required.
      Ablations show each component matters.
    subsections:
      - Setup and Baselines
      - Main Results
      - Ablation Studies
      - Analysis
    citation_density: medium

  - number: 6
    name: Conclusion
    slug: conclusion
    word_ratio: 0.05
    purpose: |
      Brief wrap-up. Limitations often required section.
    subsections:
      - Summary
      - Limitations
      - Future Work
    citation_density: none

optional_sections:
  - name: Abstract
    position: before_introduction
    word_limit: 200
  - name: Broader Impact
    position: after_conclusion
  - name: Appendix
    position: end
    notes: Proofs, additional experiments, hyperparameters

citation_style: neurips
page_limit_hint: "8-9 pages + references + appendix"

notes: |
  - ML reviewers skim - make contributions crystal clear
  - Notation consistency is critical
  - Standard benchmarks expected (ImageNet, GLUE, etc.)
  - Ablations are mandatory, not optional
  - Broader Impact/Ethics statement increasingly required
