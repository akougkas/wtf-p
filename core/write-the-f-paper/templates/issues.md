## When to Log vs When to Fix

**Log to ISSUES.md:**
- Nice-to-haves discovered during writing
- Improvements that would delay current section
- Ideas for future revision
- Minor clarity issues that don't block comprehension

**Fix immediately (don't log):**
- Factual errors
- Logical contradictions
- Missing required elements
- Broken citations

The distinction: If a reviewer would reject the paper for it, fix it now. If a reviewer might suggest it as an improvement, log it for later.
