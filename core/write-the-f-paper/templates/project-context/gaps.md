# Research & Evidence Gaps

**Created:** [date]
**Last updated:** [date]
**Status:** [X] open / [Y] resolved

## Critical Gaps (Must Address)

These gaps would cause rejection if not addressed.

### GAP-001: [Brief description]

**Type:** [Evidence / Citation / Logic / Data]
**Location:** [Section where gap appears]
**The gap:** [What's missing or weak]
**Impact:** [Why this matters for the argument]
**Status:** [Open / In progress / Resolved]

**Potential solutions:**
1. [Option 1]
2. [Option 2]

**Chosen approach:** [How we're addressing it]
**Resolution notes:** [What was done, if resolved]

### GAP-002: [Brief description]

[Same structure...]

## Major Gaps (Should Address)

These weaken the paper but may not cause rejection.

### GAP-003: [Brief description]

**Type:** [Evidence / Citation / Logic / Data]
**Location:** [Section]
**The gap:** [What's missing]
**Impact:** [How it weakens the argument]
**Status:** [Open / In progress / Resolved / Acknowledged as limitation]

**Potential solutions:**
1. [Option 1]
2. [Option 2]

**Chosen approach:** [How we're addressing it or acknowledging it]

## Minor Gaps (Nice to Address)

These are minor weaknesses reviewers might note.

### GAP-004: [Brief description]

**Type:** [Evidence / Citation / Logic / Data]
**Location:** [Section]
**The gap:** [What's missing]
**Status:** [Open / Deferred]
**Notes:** [Brief notes]

## Acknowledged Limitations

Gaps we're explicitly calling out rather than fixing.

| Gap | Acknowledgment Location | Rationale for Not Fixing |
|-----|------------------------|-------------------------|
| GAP-003 | Discussion, para 5 | Would require additional study |
| [ID] | [Location] | [Why not fixed] |

## Gap Summary

| Priority | Total | Open | Resolved | Acknowledged |
|----------|-------|------|----------|--------------|
| Critical | X | Y | Z | - |
| Major | X | Y | Z | A |
| Minor | X | Y | Z | A |

<guidelines>

**Gap types:**
- Evidence: Need more data/examples
- Citation: Need supporting literature
- Logic: Argument leap without justification
- Data: Missing statistics or analysis

**Priority levels:**
- Critical: Reviewers will reject without this
- Major: Weakens paper significantly
- Minor: Would be nice to have

**Status values:**
- Open: Not yet addressed
- In progress: Working on it
- Resolved: Fixed
- Acknowledged: Noted as limitation

**When to update:**
- After writing each section
- After review/verification
- After getting feedback

**Integration:**
- Link to argument-map.md gaps section
- Reference in STATE.md
- Check during review-section
