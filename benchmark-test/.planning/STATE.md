# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-11)

**Core argument:** Reality has seams. Dr. Elena Voss, a theoretical physicist turned reluctant explorer, must map the boundaries between parallel worlds before they collapse into each other. Each chapter takes place in a different version of Earth.

**Current focus:** Section 1 — The First Seam

## Current Position

Section: 1 of 4 (The First Seam)
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan

## Word Count

| Section | Target | Current | % |
|---------|--------|---------|---|
| Chapter 1: The First Seam | 3,500 | 0 | 0% |
| Chapter 2: Clockwork Empire | 3,750 | 0 | 0% |

| **Total** | **15,000** | **0** | **0%** |

## Argument Strength

**Core thesis:** Developing
**Evidence gaps:** Character motivation for crossing seams established in Ch. 1; Physics of seams still needs internal consistency work; Payoff in Ch. 4 needs to align with discoveries in Ch. 2-3
**Logic flow:** Not yet established

**By Section:**

## Open Questions

1. How explicitly should seam navigation be explained in Ch1?
2. What pacing for Elena's emotional arc across 4 chapters?
3. How much scientific accuracy vs. speculative freedom in physics?
4. Should each world's prose style shift be subtle or dramatic?
