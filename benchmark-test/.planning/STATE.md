# Project State: The Quantum Cartographer

## Current Position

**Current section:** Chapter 1: "The First Seam"

**Progress:** Planning phase - about to create PLAN.md for Section 1

**Next action:** Execute plan-section.md workflow to generate Section 1 writing plan

## Accumulated Decisions

### POV & Tense
- **POV:** First-person (Elena)
- **Tense:** Present tense for immediacy
- **Rationale:** Intimacy with Elena's internal journey, immediacy of discovery
- **Impact:** All chapters must maintain this consistency

### Prose Style per World
- **Decision:** Each world has distinct prose style to reinforce reality-shifts
- **Example:** Chapter 1 (Geneva lab) = scientific, precise; Chapter 2 (Clockwork Empire) = ornate, mechanical; Chapter 3 (Roma Aeterna) = rhythmic, classical
- **Status:** Decided, needs implementation guidance in each chapter plan

### Thematic Focus
- **Core question:** What makes a world "real"?
- **Secondary:** What does it cost to see beyond consensus reality?
- **Avoid:** Romance subplots, detailed alternate history exposition, guaranteed happy endings

## Open Questions

### For Section 1 specifically:
1. How technical should Elena's discovery be? (Physics jargon vs. accessible narrative)
2. How much of Elena's backstory to include? (Burnt-out state setup)
3. What tone for the lab scene? (Quiet desperation vs. intellectual excitement)
4. How to end the chapter? (Hard cliff-hanger vs. subtle question mark)

### For overall novel:
1. Does Elena travel between worlds voluntarily or involuntarily?
2. Are "seams" visible to her eyes or only to instruments?
3. What are the stakes of seam collapse? (Personal consequences? Existential?)

## Argument Strength

| Claim | Strength | Evidence | Status |
|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| Science can reveal the impossible | Strong | Elena's accidental discovery | Core premise |
| Each world has its own internal logic | Building | Distinct tech/culture per chapter | Chapters 2-3 prove this |
| The observer changes by observing | Culminates | Elena's transformation arc | Chapter 4 payoff |
| Reality is consensus | Strong (abstract) | Convergence of Chapters 1-3 | Needs narrative proof |

## Completed Work

None yet. Project initialized with PROJECT.md, argument-map.md, narrative-arc.md.

## Word Count Tracking

| Section | Target | Current | Notes |
|---------|--------|---------|-------|
| 1. "The First Seam" | 3,750 | 0 | Planning |
| 2. "Clockwork Empire" | 3,750 | 0 | Not started |
| 3. "Roma Aeterna" | 3,750 | 0 | Not started |
| 4. "The Luminous Collective" | 3,750 | 0 | Not started |
| **Total** | **15,000** | **0** | **0%** |

## Next Steps

1. Execute plan-section.md workflow for Section 1
2. Create .planning/sections/01-the-first-seam/ directory
3. Generate 01-01-PLAN.md and 01-02-PLAN.md (two writing plans for Section 1)
4. Commit plans to git
5. Begin writing Section 1 using /wtfp:write-section workflow
