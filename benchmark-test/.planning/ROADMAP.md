# Roadmap: The Quantum Cartographer

## Overview

A 4-chapter fantasy/sci-fi novel following Dr. Elena Voss as she discovers and maps the seams between parallel worlds, transforming from a burnt-out physicist into a cartographer of infinite realities. Each chapter takes place in a different version of Earth, exploring how reality is constructed and what it means to be "real."

## Document Structure

**Type:** Multi-chapter Literary Sci-Fi Novel

**Target Length:** ~15,000 words (3,500-4,000 per chapter)

**Style Requirements:**
- First-person POV (Elena)
- Present tense for immediacy
- Each world has distinct prose style to reinforce reality-shifts
- Literary sci-fi, not pulp adventure

## Domain Expertise

Paths to domain knowledge that inform writing:

- .planning/structure/argument-map.md (Central thesis and supporting claims)
- .planning/structure/narrative-arc.md (Three-act structure and reader experience)
- .planning/PROJECT.md (Core requirements and constraints)

## Sections

**Section Numbering:**
- Integer sections (1, 2, 3, 4): Planned document structure
- Decimal sections: Urgent insertions between integers (if needed)

- [ ] **Section 1: "The First Seam"** - Elena's discovery in her Geneva lab, the opening act
- [ ] **Section 2: "Clockwork Empire"** - Victorian London with steam-powered reality anchors, first exploration
- [ ] **Section 3: "Roma Aeterna"** - Rome in 2024 where Latin is lingua franca, second exploration
- [ ] **Section 4: "The Luminous Collective"** - Far future where humanity is pure consciousness, resolution

## Section Details

### Section 1: "The First Seam"

**Goal:** Establish Elena's character, her burnt-out state, and introduce the anomaly that shatters her worldview. Hook the reader with "the particle detector showed something that couldn't exist."

**Depends on:** Argument map and narrative arc

**Research:** Unlikely (focused on Elena's emotional journey and lab discovery, not external facts)

**Plans:** 2 plans

**Word budget:** ~3,500-4,000 words

Plans:
- [ ] 01-01: Opening and Elena's characterization (burnt-out physicist, Geneva lab setup)
- [ ] 01-02: The discovery (anomaly detection, impossible readings, cliff-hanger ending)

### Section 2: "Clockwork Empire"

**Goal:** First exploration of an alternate world; demonstrate that reality varies by world, introduce "seams" as navigable boundaries. Show how technology can anchor reality.

**Depends on:** Section 1 (Elena's discovery; she must journey to this world)

**Research:** Unlikely (world-building from imagination; internal logic of seams)

**Plans:** 2 plans

**Word budget:** ~3,500-4,000 words

Plans:
- [ ] 02-01: Elena's arrival and Victorian London orientation (steam-powered tech, changed Earth)
- [ ] 02-02: Discovery of how this world is anchored (steam-powered reality anchors), deeper questions

### Section 3: "Roma Aeterna"

**Goal:** Second exploration showing a different approach to anchoring reality. Demonstrate that culture and language shape what is "real." Build Elena's understanding.

**Depends on:** Section 2 (Elena knows worlds vary; deeper knowledge)

**Research:** Unlikely (imagined alternate Rome; seam mechanics already established)

**Plans:** 2 plans

**Word budget:** ~3,500-4,000 words

Plans:
- [ ] 03-01: Elena's arrival in 2024 Rome where Latin is lingua franca (language as reality anchor)
- [ ] 03-02: Insight into consensus reality (how culture shapes what's "real"), preparation for transcendence

### Section 4: "The Luminous Collective"

**Goal:** Resolution and transcendence. Elena realizes reality is consensus; seams appear where consensus breaks. She transforms and becomes a "cartographer of the infinite." Reader gains insight that their own reality is contingent.

**Depends on:** Sections 1-3 (synthesis of all lessons learned)

**Research:** Unlikely (pure speculative extrapolation; Elena's internal transformation)

**Plans:** 2 plans

**Word budget:** ~3,500-4,000 words

Plans:
- [ ] 04-01: The far future collective and the final revelation (consciousness, consensus, transcendence)
- [ ] 04-02: Elena's transformation and the payoff (seams reveal the infinite, reader's reality unsettled)
