**Chapter 1, Part 1: "The First Seam" - Opening and Elena's Characterization**

Purpose: Establish Elena Voss as a burnt-out theoretical physicist, ground the reader in her Geneva lab, and set up the emotional stakes before the discovery. Show her internal conflict: brilliant mind questioning whether her life's work matters.

Output: ~1,800 words covering Elena's character, her lab environment, her state of mind, and the opening of her discovery sequence.
</objective>

<context>
@.planning/PROJECT.md
@.planning/ROADMAP.md
@.planning/structure/argument-map.md (Claim 1: Science can reveal the impossible - Elena's discovery is the evidence)
@.planning/structure/narrative-arc.md (Act 1: The Problem - Elena is burnt-out, questioning her work)
@.planning/STATE.md (POV: first-person present tense; Tone for lab scene: quiet desperation with intellectual undercurrent)

**Argument thread:** Establish Elena as credible observer whose worldview is about to shatter. Her scientific credentials matter because only someone who understands physics can recognize an anomaly.

**Style guidance:** 
- POV: First-person present tense (Elena's voice)
- Prose style: Precise, scientific observations mixed with emotional exhaustion. Short sentences when Elena is frustrated, longer when she's absorbed in work.
- Avoid: Heavy exposition dumps about her past. Show burnout through action and thought.

**Key decisions constraining this section:**
- Present tense creates immediacy; use it consistently
- Elena's voice should sound like an educated physicist, but readable (not jargon-heavy)
- Establish her solitude in the lab as meaningful (foreshadows her journey alone between worlds)

<tasks>
<task type="auto" mode="co-author">
  <name>Opening: Elena arrives at the lab</name>
  <target>400-500 words</target>
  <action>
    Write the opening scene of Elena entering her Geneva lab on a morning that will change everything. Establish:
    1. Physical setting: Lab details (particle detector equipment, monitors, coffee-stained desk - show her environment)
    2. Internal state: What's happening in Elena's mind? Routine fatigue, questioning whether this matters, sense of stagnation
    3. Tone: Quiet desperation underlying competence. She's good at her job but lost her sense of why
    4. Hint at isolation: She's alone here. This matters later.

    Key phrase to work toward: Something that captures her burnt-out state while showing she still understands the work deeply (e.g., "I could recite the theory in my sleep, but the theory had stopped speaking to me.")

    Present tense, first-person. Show, don't tell her burnout.

<task type="auto" mode="co-author">
  <name>Middle: Elena's routine and the first anomaly</name>
  <target>900-1000 words</target>
  <action>
    Write Elena settling into her work routine, checking particle detector data, and noticing something wrong. Include:
    1. Her methodology: What is she working on? (Theoretical physics, particle detection - keep it grounded but not overly technical)
    2. The rhythm of routine: Checking screens, reviewing data, the comfortable pattern of familiar work
    3. The anomaly: First subtle hint that something is off. A reading that shouldn't exist. A pattern that breaks the rules.
    4. Escalation: Elena's initial reaction - is she misreading? Checking again. Growing realization that this is real.
    5. Emotional beat: Not excitement yet, but a crack in her numbness. Something is waking her up.

    Key points:
    - Make the discovery credible: Elena notices because she understands the equipment intimately
    - Don't explain what "seams" are yet - she doesn't know. She just sees impossible data
    - Plant tension: She's aware this could be equipment malfunction or her own error, but it doesn't feel like either
    - End on a note of uncertainty: She's standing on the edge of believing something impossible

    Present tense throughout. Use Elena's technical knowledge to build credibility.

    2. Does the lab environment feel grounded and vivid?
    3. Is the anomaly discovery compelling and scientifically credible?
    4. Does the present-tense POV feel immediate and engaging?

Before declaring Part 1 complete:
- [ ] Word count: ~1,800 ±100 words
- [ ] Elena's character established (burnt-out, intelligent, isolated)
- [ ] Lab setting is grounded and specific
- [ ] Discovery of anomaly is credible and compelling
- [ ] Present-tense first-person POV consistent throughout
- [ ] No heavy exposition about Elena's past
- [ ] Emotional stakes are clear: Elena's worldview is about to crack
- [ ] Flows naturally into Part 2 (deeper exploration of the data)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Part 1 is complete when:
- Prose is readable and engaging (literary sci-fi, not pulp)
- Elena feels like a credible observer whose opinion matters
- The opening anomaly is mysterious and compelling
- Reader understands why Elena will pursue this, even though it challenges her sanity
- Checkpoint passes user verification
</success_criteria>

<output>
After writing Tasks 1-2 and passing checkpoint, output a temporary DRAFT.md containing:
- The full Part 1 text (1,800 words)
- Elena's voice established
- Anomaly introduced, ready for Part 2's deeper analysis
</output>
